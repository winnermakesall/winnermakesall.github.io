First, Stories from Snapchat. Now, online storefronts from Shopify. Here are the 5 main features of Facebook Shops:</p>\n<p>Note: If you’re wondering why there aren’t a lot of storefronts on Facebook yet, it’s because they’re planning to roll out functionality and access to all business accounts over the coming months.</p>\n<h4>1. The Storefront</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Business Facing</strong>: Business owners will be able to spin up a customized digital storefront that’s unified across Facebook and Instagram and native to the platform. Once business owners create their Shop, they can then add products one by one or import them all from their preexisting e-commerce site. In addition, they can create collections around the products to convey a theme or simply display a curated selection. All of this is simultaneously updated across Facebook and Instagram.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customer Facing</strong>: Users can access a business’s Shop directly on their Facebook and Instagram profiles (as seen in the images below) and buy products without ever being forced to go to another website. Later this year, Instagram will add a Shop tab in Instagram Explore to allow users to browse products from various companies.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/9873e376964cfe8976eb311d48312195/28492/fb_shops.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 497px;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 56.33802816901409%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"fb shops\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/9873e376964cfe8976eb311d48312195/28492/fb_shops.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9873e376964cfe8976eb311d48312195/e33f8/fb_shops.jpg 293w,\n/static/9873e376964cfe8976eb311d48312195/28492/fb_shops.jpg 497w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<h4>2. Facebook Checkout</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Easy Pay</strong>:  When placing an order, customers will have the ability to use Facebook Pay across all stores instead of inputting credit card information every time. This easy, one-click purchase system would be present for all Shops.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Transaction Fees</strong>:  Facebook will charge businesses “5% per shipment, or a flat fee of $0.40 for shipments of $8.00 or less”. This fee includes taxes and the cost of payment processing.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>3. Streamlined Communication</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Customers can seamlessly message the business over Messenger, Instagram DM’s, or Whatsapp to ask questions about products or shipping. Once an order is placed, customers will then receive order/shipping updates through Messenger or Instagram DM’s.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>4. New Selling Channel</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Facebook and Instagram Live:</strong> If a business is streaming over Facebook Live or Instagram Live, customers can now easily swipe up on mobile or click a link on desktop to purchase any products being showcased.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Loyalty Programs:</strong> Businesses can create loyalty programs that offer dynamic incentives to customers through targeted advertisements or automated messages for higher engagement. For example, customers can rack up “points” as they shop or complete certain activities (following an account), which they will then be able to redeem for product discounts.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>5. Partnerships</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Finally, Facebook Shops isn’t operating in a vacuum. In fact, Facebook partnered with Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, and many other major players to provide easy integrations and allow entrepreneurs to access as many selling channels as possible.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How this Affects Small/Medium Businesses</h3>\n<p>We can imagine that each of these options will appeal to different customers, and they can choose what is best for them. The question now becomes how to design an underwriting process that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduces time of underwriting</li>\n<li>Allows a startup to only pay interest on the debt it immediately needs.</li>\n<li>Gives the lender high conviction that the startup can pay.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We now turn to some metrics that we believe will be useful for underwriting debt products.</p>\n<div style=\"max-width:400px; margin: auto\">\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/283b4e7c42e1202d4f892d346409f665/5fae0/metrics.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1170px;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 53.8125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"metrics\" title src=\"/static/283b4e7c42e1202d4f892d346409f665/913fc/metrics.png\" srcset=\"/static/283b4e7c42e1202d4f892d346409f665/bc34b/metrics.png 293w,\n/static/283b4e7c42e1202d4f892d346409f665/da9f0/metrics.png 585w,\n/static/283b4e7c42e1202d4f892d346409f665/913fc/metrics.png 1170w,\n/static/283b4e7c42e1202d4f892d346409f665/5fae0/metrics.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px\">\n  </span>\n  </a>\n</div>\n<h3>Solving 3&#x26;4: Metric Based Underwriting</h3>\n<p>A growth stage tech company may be worthy of debt if it can show strength across these three fronts</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Retention</li>\n<li>Margin</li>\n<li>Growth</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Retention</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Revenue Churn:</strong> Revenue churn rather than customer churn is often more telling for later stage company health. Regular customer churn does not illustrate whether it is your so-so customers or your strongest customers that are churning. For mature startups small monthly churns compound to massive numbers. 3% monthly churn => 31% yearly churn. Recovering this in the form of acquiring new customers is very expensive. This is a vital metric that must stay low in order for a company to be debt grade.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Net Churn:</strong> Revenue lost due to churn and contraction - Revenue gained from current customers . If this number is negative it shows that the company is able to grow revenues without adding new customers. This is a very positive sign for any debt issuer.  </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Margin</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lifetime Value (LTV) >= 3 * Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</strong>: This is a pretty simple rule of thumb but foundational to ensure good unit economics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Time to recover CAC:</strong> CAC / Average MRR (monthly recurring revenue) of customer .This number is paramount to formulate the terms of the loan. If it takes 2 years to recover CAC, then creating a debt instrument whose lifetime is one year will just cause liquidity problems for the company.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Growth</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>MRR:</strong> Plain and simple. There needs to be enough future cash flows to service the debt.</li>\n<li><strong>Expansion Revenue:</strong> additional revenue from current customers. Upselling and cross selling your current customers is a quicker way to generate returns than going after newer customers. Thus expansion revenue is more appropriate to service debt, which lies on a shorter time frame than equity</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These metrics are constantly evolving and as such capital could be deployed incrementally. As long as the KPI thresholds are met, the next round is deployed. This is mutually beneficial for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It protects the lender from <strong>overcommitting capital.</strong> They only are obliged to invest if the metrics continuously look good</li>\n<li><strong>It prevents SaaS companies from having to frontload on debt and having to pay interest for it throughout.</strong> In growth stage, capital needs six months from now could look very different than today, and a company should not have to pay interest for money it intends to use only after six months.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the last part of this exploration we ask ourselves the question “who would be the best vendors of these debt instruments?”</p>\n<h3>Why Brex, Stripe, Square are Well Positioned</h3>\n<br>\n<div style=\"max-width:400px; margin: auto\">\n  <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/41e1af7b1713886af82b860f45959153/abbb1/companies.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1170px;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 32.481751824817515%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"companies\" title src=\"/static/41e1af7b1713886af82b860f45959153/913fc/companies.png\" srcset=\"/static/41e1af7b1713886af82b860f45959153/bc34b/companies.png 293w,\n/static/41e1af7b1713886af82b860f45959153/da9f0/companies.png 585w,\n/static/41e1af7b1713886af82b860f45959153/913fc/companies.png 1170w,\n/static/41e1af7b1713886af82b860f45959153/abbb1/companies.png 1644w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px\">\n  </span>\n  </a>\n</div>\n<p>As shown above, to underwrite well, lenders will need data. We believe Brex, Stripe, and Square all have certain qualities that make them ideal candidates for providing debt in the target space. For one, all these companies have instant access to their customers’ daily revenue and account balances. They already use this to supply SMB loans. We believe they can expand their offerings to help more growth stage tech companies. And why should they bother? <strong>It is the same lesson that GE learned so many decades ago, helping to finance the growth of your customers is a great way to catalyze sales.</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Stripe (Vertical Integration): Stripe’s ecosystem of fintech and legal products give them vertical integration for anyone trying to start and grow a digital business. A SaaS company that uses Atlas to launch, Payments for credit card processing, and Billing and Payouts to handle subscription revenue and costs would be more inclined to turn to Stripe Capital if they had a debt offering unique for SaaS companies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Square (Securitization): While it is true that Square’s current customer base is mostly not SaaS companies, Square Capital is already seasoned with the business model of securitizing SMB loans. We believe this can be extended by securitizing the recurring revenue generated by SaaS companies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Brex (Industry Specialization): Brex’s goal is to become the “bank” for startups. To do this they must do two things: 1) Offer transactions and account services: This is already accomplished through Brex Cash 2) Offer lending services: This is what Brex could fulfill by offering debt instruments  </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Brex is uniquely positioned to offer debt for SaaS companies because they have a deep understanding of the types of things on which SaaS companies spend money, based on their current customers.  </p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>“Debt is bad.” Maybe so. But perhaps a part of the negative image of debt comes from its potential to challenge the reigning VC financiers. We should not pretend that a capital stack solely based on equity is always the ideal way to grow a company. Tech companies are staying private longer, and it is important that we give them the options to finance growth for the future.</p>\n<p>A special thanks to Alex Danco for his work “Debt is Coming” which was the inspiration for this piece.</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://alexdanco.com/2020/02/07/debt-is-coming/\">https://alexdanco.com/2020/02/07/debt-is-coming/</a></li>\n</ol>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Preface"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Facebook has been in the news quite a bit recently over free speech regulation controversies, employee walkouts, and potential antitrust challenges to both the Giphy acquisition ($400 million for GIFs!?) and the $5.7 billion Jio Platforms investment.
