Amidst all the activity, last month, the social media giant also announced the launch of “Facebook Shops”, in another step towards a full suite of small business sales enablement products for Facebook. While the move hasn’t received as much media fanfare, this release is pretty big news and investors certainly think so too, as $FB stock rose 8% in the three days following the official announcement. But what exactly is Shops and what does it mean for Facebook? We look to answer those questions as we take a deep dive into Facebook Shops.</p>\n<h3>Agenda</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>What is Facebook Shops?</li>\n<li>How this Affects SMBs</li>\n<li>How this Affects Facebook</li>\n<li>Potential Next Steps</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>30 Second Summary</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Facebook Shops creates a unique fully native social shopping experience for users that should give SMBs (small-medium sized businesses) better ad attribution and increased sales conversions.</li>\n<li>Facebook Shops gives Facebook access to valuable first-party shopper data which should strengthen their advertising business and help them build upon their “Walled Garden of proprietary data”</li>\n<li>It opens up future opportunities for a potential Whatsapp integration and stronger shopping recommendations.</li>\n<li>Shops may even lay the foundation for a further push into the financial services industry through small SMB loans and point-of-sale financing.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What is Facebook Shops?</h2>\n<p>Facebook <em>loves</em> drawing inspiration from other companies. First, Stories from Snapchat. Now, online storefronts from Shopify. Here are the 5 main features of Facebook Shops:</p>\n<p>Note: If you’re wondering why there aren’t a lot of storefronts on Facebook yet, it’s because they’re planning to roll out functionality and access to all business accounts over the coming months.</p>\n<h4>1. The Storefront</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Business Facing</strong>: Business owners will be able to spin up a customized digital storefront that’s unified across Facebook and Instagram and native to the platform. Once business owners create their Shop, they can then add products one by one or import them all from their preexisting e-commerce site. In addition, they can create collections around the products to convey a theme or simply display a curated selection. All of this is simultaneously updated across Facebook and Instagram.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Customer Facing</strong>: Users can access a business’s Shop directly on their Facebook and Instagram profiles (as seen in the images below) and buy products without ever being forced to go to another website. Later this year, Instagram will add a Shop tab in Instagram Explore to allow users to browse products from various companies.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/9873e376964cfe8976eb311d48312195/28492/fb_shops.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 497px;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 56.33802816901409%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"fb shops\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/9873e376964cfe8976eb311d48312195/28492/fb_shops.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9873e376964cfe8976eb311d48312195/e33f8/fb_shops.jpg 293w,\n/static/9873e376964cfe8976eb311d48312195/28492/fb_shops.jpg 497w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<h4>2. Facebook Checkout</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Easy Pay</strong>:  When placing an order, customers will have the ability to use Facebook Pay across all stores instead of inputting credit card information every time. This easy, one-click purchase system would be present for all Shops.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Transaction Fees</strong>:  Facebook will charge businesses “5% per shipment, or a flat fee of $0.40 for shipments of $8.00 or less”. This fee includes taxes and the cost of payment processing.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>3. Streamlined Communication</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Customers can seamlessly message the business over Messenger, Instagram DM’s, or Whatsapp to ask questions about products or shipping. Once an order is placed, customers will then receive order/shipping updates through Messenger or Instagram DM’s.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>4. New Selling Channel</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Facebook and Instagram Live:</strong> If a business is streaming over Facebook Live or Instagram Live, customers can now easily swipe up on mobile or click a link on desktop to purchase any products being showcased.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Loyalty Programs:</strong> Businesses can create loyalty programs that offer dynamic incentives to customers through targeted advertisements or automated messages for higher engagement. For example, customers can rack up “points” as they shop or complete certain activities (following an account), which they will then be able to redeem for product discounts.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>5. Partnerships</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Finally, Facebook Shops isn’t operating in a vacuum. In fact, Facebook partnered with Shopify, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, and many other major players to provide easy integrations and allow entrepreneurs to access as many selling channels as possible.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How this Affects Small/Medium Businesses</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Need For E-Commerce:</strong>\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has further heightened the importance of having an online e-commerce presence. With nationwide stay-at-home orders, millions of Americans have turned to online shopping and, whether they like it or not, are developing new online buying habits. Facebook Shops thus gives SMBs who need an e-commerce solution a lightweight option to set up a virtual storefront and facilitate online transactions at no upfront cost on a platform that millions of people use and trust.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reducing Friction in the User Purchasing Journey</strong>\nAs for the reported 90 million SMBs already on Facebook, being able to set up an additional storefront on a platform where they already do a majority of their online advertising, should help reduce friction in the user purchasing journey, which would ultimately lead to more sales. As eMarketer’s Andrew Lipsman puts it, Facebook is generally seen as an “upper-level funnel” where people discover products they might purchase in the future. <strong>Adding purchasing capabilities would flatten that funnel, reducing the steps the user has to take to ultimately purchase that item they discovered on Facebook.</strong> The auto-filling easy pay feature across all shops (which leverages Facebook’s unique network effect) should also help increase conversions as purchases can be made in a matter of seconds (rather than minutes).  And lastly, a reduced number of steps in the purchasing journey means fewer steps that need to be tracked, which should allow Facebook to provide clearer and simpler attribution models for SMBs.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How this Affects Facebook</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Filling a Void in E-commerce with Social Commerce</strong>\nWhen you know you want to buy something, Amazon is unequivocally the place you go to. But, as Jeremy Bowman from the Motley Fool says, Facebook provides something that Amazon can’t: discovery. As we touched on earlier, Facebook and Instagram are often sources of ideas for future purchases. A study done by GlobalWebIndex with over 100,000 internet US and UK internet users, found that 42% of consumers research products through social media. Whether it’s that nasty Paul George dunk with his new Nike PG4 shoes or your friend’s comment about Shake Shack, brands are everywhere on Facebook and users are constantly interacting with them.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4c15abc1ebc77b997ec62c0df1e9d7ba/46077/social_commerce.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 905px;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 62.87292817679558%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAANCAIAAAAmMtkJAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAB10lEQVQoz6WSS2sTURzF8x38Bj6g+AF0oct2aYtWV1mKO9vaLpo2ceHGFyKaolL7NJNG0UWh2lq6aaIiKIHaZGaS1EmCYg02j5nJvbnzuDcz8X8nRkihUOi5Pw5n/twzc5kZX+sI8pXLZVmW8/l8LpdTFCWvKLIkFQsFuLQ8IYRwt2ACc142DKNWq2mapqoqBHBd46pWqwRjRm3TIB2MjhtNxnj5SMfOfFpZvndtNTz69uH1tamxd49GAMir4RvxyO2EcLeLyJ2PsQef34RRpcTLW+vC3Ehv7OaVpeBgdPLiUvCSxyB4ZPwCEA0M/EcY738Zuvz6lr/66zsvmxYmlk5MHRPVoqRhaBAQrhALQSZmvWHqdVwBWi13/7Hfr9wfunosONozMXwyMHwC3ONUYOh4aOz08ym/bRFouY7jwmo2nSYDXJffyPentCNub2SleEaKZ6VEVoxnxE0AJulvazl507YJY4ZtY8BxWNeTS7tft5LPpJSQ3n4hpaJiSshIr0SeBU3dYRQ3GnuovovQb137SSnxWv/O70t+efL0cc/CzLm56bPAPPczi7Pno4t9P4of+EbXOfBTMcYotUHw03CHBdE2KbVcT7ze0f5yewjAG2mHNofRXybLnZkd1bk6AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"fb shops\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/4c15abc1ebc77b997ec62c0df1e9d7ba/46077/social_commerce.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4c15abc1ebc77b997ec62c0df1e9d7ba/bc34b/social_commerce.png 293w,\n/static/4c15abc1ebc77b997ec62c0df1e9d7ba/da9f0/social_commerce.png 585w,\n/static/4c15abc1ebc77b997ec62c0df1e9d7ba/46077/social_commerce.png 905w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 905px) 100vw, 905px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>This makes Shops a natural next step for Facebook to further monetize their audience and create a unique social commerce experience that keeps users on Facebook. And with 2.4 billion daily active users across Facebook, Whatsapp, and Instagram – each spending around <strong>38 minutes a day across the apps</strong> – Shops represents a big opportunity. Amazon should continue to be the place to go if you know you want to buy something, but Facebook Shops could very well be the place for casual shoppers simply looking for inspiration.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Strengthening Facebook’s Advertising Business</strong>\nWhile additional revenue from Shops’ transaction fees would diversify Facebook’s revenue stream, advertising is where Shops should bring the biggest benefits for Facebook. Facebook and Google have a duopoly on the digital ads market, but Amazon has seen the biggest growth going from practically <strong>$2.96 billion in 2016 to over $14 billion</strong> in ads revenue last year.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4d489eab924ef86f3ca89cc912db5d4b/ab9d5/amazon_ad.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 638px;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 57.993730407523515%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"fb shops\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/4d489eab924ef86f3ca89cc912db5d4b/ab9d5/amazon_ad.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4d489eab924ef86f3ca89cc912db5d4b/bc34b/amazon_ad.png 293w,\n/static/4d489eab924ef86f3ca89cc912db5d4b/da9f0/amazon_ad.png 585w,\n/static/4d489eab924ef86f3ca89cc912db5d4b/ab9d5/amazon_ad.png 638w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>Amazon’s success has primarily been centered around the fact that it has an enormous amount of shopper data by virtue of being the top destination for product searches and purchases. Just as importantly though, since transactions occur in the same ecosystem as the ads being run, Amazon can accurately attribute ad impressions directly to actual purchases, giving ad buyers a clear picture of the effectiveness of their campaigns.</p>\n<p>With Shops, Facebook can emulate Amazon by generating their own shopper data to improve ad retargeting and provide clearer ad attribution. This should make Facebook ads more valuable and even a small increase in ad prices could translate to <strong>billions</strong> of dollars in additional revenue. Deutsche Bank’s Lloyd Walmsley, for example, thinks Shops could drive as much as $30 billion in incremental revenue. And, as Mark Zuckerberg himself says, “we know that if Shops are valuable for businesses they’re going to in general want to bid more for ads”.  </p>\n<p>3.<strong>First-Party Data and Building a “Walled Garden”</strong>\nThere’s no question that the ad-tech space has been in the midst of a significant shift ever since Google’s announcement in January that it would be eliminating third party cookies. At a high level, third party cookies are pieces of data placed onto your browser by advertisers on a website where their ads are displayed, that allow advertisers to track your activity and send you targeted ads. So if you’re on the New York Times, for example, third party cookies are what allows digital advertisers to send you those creepy ads about the Adidas shoes you just looked at.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether Google’s intentions behind eliminating third party cookies were for the “greater good” of privacy or not, the move has put a higher emphasis on first-party data, which is data collected by the owner of the site you are visiting. First-party data typically consists of a user’s identity, such as a name or email, as well as behaviors, such as browsing history or purchase patterns. Generally, first-party data is seen as  “less creepy” since it is voluntarily given and helps improve a user’s experience on that website  (i.e. storing passwords or auto-filling credit card payments).  </p>\n<p>As such, those who stand to gain the most from the death of third party cookies, are those who generate the most first-party data. And those players are namely Facebook, Google, and Amazon due to the “Walled Garden” nature of their ecosystems. They have access to and control all the first-party data within each of their ecosystems (hence the “Wall”) which forces advertisers to use their marketing tools as opposed to other third-party digital advertising tools if they want access to the ecosystem.  </p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ce7bcf6fb015086bdd72d6fccea6c25e/53eb4/ad_rev.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 512px;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 40.8203125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAICAIAAAB2/0i6AAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAABIUlEQVQY042Rz0rDQBDG+xy+lHfvvopIj148Ch4Ej+JJvHjwASRoLGlCmyYtiEl3N9ns/+w4mwTFQ6EfZPg27G/2Y2YGAMYYrfVYR6OUstZ67/vDQnCG33ZbfsYfy2SZJEkURVmWxXFcliXewC76v/BP13VCCGwdYOectk5JIZUWKjyrpMR7cECIjSbAnO3JbhVOToNt4WgF2D/P7fUp8M3DAs7vuXJQr1eiaToutdIYElPIIQtWDDz6KTa8XLmbMxDFxSucXPbEAtzdQrJ5qh7XfPH+Fld1laYp55xSir3atsU6wbxh37scDWuavPzCKHVR6LYr9jkTlBKKQyCE4JuMMTHoDzbW4qymnUnRe6+MsWGMrndhK773bhDu79cg/AM5D8f8xBlWtAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"fb shops\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/ce7bcf6fb015086bdd72d6fccea6c25e/53eb4/ad_rev.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ce7bcf6fb015086bdd72d6fccea6c25e/bc34b/ad_rev.png 293w,\n/static/ce7bcf6fb015086bdd72d6fccea6c25e/53eb4/ad_rev.png 512w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<h3>Solving 3&#x26;4: Metric Based Underwriting</h3>\n<p>A growth stage tech company may be worthy of debt if it can show strength across these three fronts</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Retention</li>\n<li>Margin</li>\n<li>Growth</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Retention</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Revenue Churn:</strong> Revenue churn rather than customer churn is often more telling for later stage company health. Regular customer churn does not illustrate whether it is your so-so customers or your strongest customers that are churning. For mature startups small monthly churns compound to massive numbers. 3% monthly churn => 31% yearly churn. Recovering this in the form of acquiring new customers is very expensive. This is a vital metric that must stay low in order for a company to be debt grade.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Net Churn:</strong> Revenue lost due to churn and contraction - Revenue gained from current customers . If this number is negative it shows that the company is able to grow revenues without adding new customers. This is a very positive sign for any debt issuer.  </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Margin</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lifetime Value (LTV) >= 3 * Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</strong>: This is a pretty simple rule of thumb but foundational to ensure good unit economics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Time to recover CAC:</strong> CAC / Average MRR (monthly recurring revenue) of customer .This number is paramount to formulate the terms of the loan. If it takes 2 years to recover CAC, then creating a debt instrument whose lifetime is one year will just cause liquidity problems for the company.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Growth</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>MRR:</strong> Plain and simple. There needs to be enough future cash flows to service the debt.</li>\n<li><strong>Expansion Revenue:</strong> additional revenue from current customers. Upselling and cross selling your current customers is a quicker way to generate returns than going after newer customers.

We believe Brex, Stripe, and Square all have certain qualities that make them ideal candidates for providing debt in the target space. For one, all these companies have instant access to their customers’ daily revenue and account balances. They already use this to supply SMB loans. We believe they can expand their offerings to help more growth stage tech companies. And why should they bother? <strong>It is the same lesson that GE learned so many decades ago, helping to finance the growth of your customers is a great way to catalyze sales.</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Stripe (Vertical Integration): Stripe’s ecosystem of fintech and legal products give them vertical integration for anyone trying to start and grow a digital business. A SaaS company that uses Atlas to launch, Payments for credit card processing, and Billing and Payouts to handle subscription revenue and costs would be more inclined to turn to Stripe Capital if they had a debt offering unique for SaaS companies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Square (Securitization): While it is true that Square’s current customer base is mostly not SaaS companies, Square Capital is already seasoned with the business model of securitizing SMB loans. We believe this can be extended by securitizing the recurring revenue generated by SaaS companies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Brex (Industry Specialization): Brex’s goal is to become the “bank” for startups. To do this they must do two things: 1) Offer transactions and account services: This is already accomplished through Brex Cash 2) Offer lending services: This is what Brex could fulfill by offering debt instruments  </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Brex is uniquely positioned to offer debt for SaaS companies because they have a deep understanding of the types of things on which SaaS companies spend money, based on their current customers.  </p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>“Debt is bad.” Maybe so. But perhaps a part of the negative image of debt comes from its potential to challenge the reigning VC financiers. We should not pretend that a capital stack solely based on equity is always the ideal way to grow a company. Tech companies are staying private longer, and it is important that we give them the options to finance growth for the future.</p>\n<p>A special thanks to Alex Danco for his work “Debt is Coming” which was the inspiration for this piece.</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://alexdanco.com/2020/02/07/debt-is-coming/\">https://alexdanco.com/2020/02/07/debt-is-coming/</a></li>\n</ol>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Preface"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Facebook has been in the news quite a bit recently over free speech regulation controversies, employee walkouts, and potential antitrust challenges to both the Giphy acquisition ($400 million for GIFs!?) and the $5.7 billion Jio Platforms investment.
