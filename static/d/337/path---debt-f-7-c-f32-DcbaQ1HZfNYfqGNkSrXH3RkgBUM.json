Well for a more mature company that does have product-market fit and solvent unit economics, growth is the first priority.

Companies can ask for a cash advance on their future sales for a fixed percentage fee (5%), and then pay back the lender as their revenue rolls in. Meanwhile, they can use the cash advance to fuel growth now.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A Fixed Income Instrument:</strong> This is a bit more of a bet for the lender. Lenders can offer large loans in exchange for a fixed percentage of future revenues for a pre-established time period. For example, a lender (like Stripe or Square Capital) offers 1 million dollars in exchange for 3% of monthly revenues for the next 24 months. Of course, these are arbitrary numbers, but note that this is a product designed specifically for high margin SaaS companies that can afford 3%, and for Stripe/Square to offer, since it may be the one handling payments for the company in the first place!

This is somewhat similar to #2 on this list, but the lender could securitize across many companies and then sell the financial instrument to any interested buyer. Because the instrument is now diversified (in some sense), it may be less risky overall. It also allows the lender to get the loan off its balance sheet, which may be in its interest depending on the particular details.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can imagine that each of these options will appeal to different customers, and they can choose what is best for them.
