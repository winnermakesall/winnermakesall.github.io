Pre IPO preparations are fully underway as the company is busily expanding its rewards program and developing self driving vehicles. Amongst all of this activity, I’d like analyze an Uber product that I feel is often overlooked: <strong>The Uber Credit Card</strong>. I understand that this is not a brand new product. But in this article I hope to demonstrate why Uber entered this market and why it structured the card the way it did. Furthermore, I’d like to illustrate the thought process a business uses when it considers entering a new market.</p>\n<p>A little about the Uber credit card. One can easily apply for the card within the Uber app. It has zero annual fees and gives the following cash back rewards:</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/692aea1b2b50cfe3af3b180beff69f93/a4a56/rewards.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 494px;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 25.708502024291498%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Credit Card Rewards\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/692aea1b2b50cfe3af3b180beff69f93/a4a56/rewards.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/692aea1b2b50cfe3af3b180beff69f93/e33f8/rewards.jpg 293w,\n/static/692aea1b2b50cfe3af3b180beff69f93/a4a56/rewards.jpg 494w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>The Uber Card is a partnership between <strong>Uber, Visa, and Barclays</strong>.

Indeed this is a major reason that airlines issue such credit cards. But this idea simply ignores the facts. The Uber card offers 2% cash back on all online purchases. This means you would be getting the same rewards from an Uber ride as you would from a Lyft ride. So clearly Uber’s goal here is not to generate loyalty through some exclusive benefits program. Indeed it has a separate rewards program for that very purpose.</p>\n<div>\n    <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/f33032c1ff9202ec4a00d3f58a2a2571/2e22a/revenue.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1170px;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 54.01234567901234%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"revenue\" title src=\"/static/f33032c1ff9202ec4a00d3f58a2a2571/913fc/revenue.png\" srcset=\"/static/f33032c1ff9202ec4a00d3f58a2a2571/bc34b/revenue.png 293w,\n/static/f33032c1ff9202ec4a00d3f58a2a2571/da9f0/revenue.png 585w,\n/static/f33032c1ff9202ec4a00d3f58a2a2571/913fc/revenue.png 1170w,\n/static/f33032c1ff9202ec4a00d3f58a2a2571/2e22a/revenue.png 1296w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px\">\n  </span>\n  </a>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Hypothesis 2</strong>: Improve Liquidity. Uber took on a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/15/tech/uber-2018-financial-report/index.html\">staggering loss of $1.8 billion last year</a>. So opening up new lines of business that can help the company regenerate its cash coffers makes sense. The question then becomes, approximately how much revenue could Uber hope to earn. To answer this, let’s do some quick market sizing shall we?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The transaction fee for each credit card purchase is about 2.4%. Once Visa, Barclays, and the acquirer(think of these as the guys who give the physical credit card reading hardware) get their cut, <strong>Uber is left with say about .1% on every transaction</strong>. (I’m not even going to include Uber’s potential cut of the interest payments from overdue balances)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Uber reaches about 75 million different users a year. <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/en-UA/blog/cash-and-card-ua-en/\">About 70% of these users pay with credit card</a>. Let’s assume the average Uber credit user spends $20,000 a year (This represents an estimated average of users from both developed and emerging markets). If Uber can convert even 10% of these users to the Uber credit card then it can make <strong>$105 million a year</strong>. What’s really amazing is that Uber has pretty much <strong>risked nothing</strong>. Remember it is Barclays that is supplying the money to back the card.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the idea of a side credit card business generating so much cash seems outlandish to you, consider that <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/2019/04/03/are-airlines-making-more-money-credit-cards-flying/\">Delta would have gone bankrupt several times if not for its lucrative credit card business</a>.</p>\n<div>\n   <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/44e1937319f1c4ceaa4cc7799740b667/ce2cf/delta_card.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 500px;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 63.4%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"delta card\" title src=\"/static/44e1937319f1c4ceaa4cc7799740b667/ce2cf/delta_card.png\" srcset=\"/static/44e1937319f1c4ceaa4cc7799740b667/bc34b/delta_card.png 293w,\n/static/44e1937319f1c4ceaa4cc7799740b667/ce2cf/delta_card.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\">\n  </span>\n  </a>\n</div>\n<p>Okay, so we have identified a clear reason why Uber might want to enter this market. However, even with clear motives for entry, there must be a scalable way for a business to distribute and advertise its product in order to be successful.</p>\n<h3>Distribution</h3>\n<p>Traditional credit card companies and banks may have countless brick and mortar locations and spend fortunes on advertising to spread the word on their products. In fact customer acquisition costs in this industry is routinely around <strong>$800 per new user</strong>. Uber simply does not have the cash or real estate to match competitors on these traditional distribution channels.</p>\n<p>What Uber does have is its app, and that might be the only channel it needs. As stated earlier, about 75% of Uber’s 90 million monthly users pay with a credit card. This alone is an audience that is bigger than all but the three largest credit card issuers (Visa, Mastercard, and Chase). Because the signup process takes place directly in the app, Uber has a clear means of distribution that it can access without having to spend the same mammoth budgets on advertising as other credit card companies.</p>\n<h3>Clear advantage over competitors?</h3>\n<p>Even with strong motives and distribution. A company’s market entry can only succeed if it has significant advantages over competitors. These advantages can come from:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A product that is magnitudes better than current options in major performance indicators such as speed, price, etc. (If you go with this option Peter Thiel claims you must be at least 10x better)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A product that addresses a major market gap. Ex (An unmet consumer need or a segment of the market which is left out)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The overall Uber credit card is nothing standout so it must address a market gap to be successful. Our job is to find such a gap if it exists. We will do this by <strong>segmenting the market</strong>. Demographics, Geography, and Activities are all common segmentation techniques (amongst others). There doesn’t seem to be any major Geographical forces at play so I will leave this one out. From an activities perspective, it is true that Uber rewards traveling generously so you could say Uber is trying to target frequent travelers. But the problem is that this segment of the market already has plenty of cards that meet its needs well (Uber offers no advantage to this segment).</p>\n<p>A third way we can segment the market is by <strong>Demographics</strong>. If we break up the credit card market by generation we see some interesting statistics:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Less than a third of Millennials say they have a credit card, while more than half of people age 30-49 own one and nearly 70% of people over 65 do - Bankrate</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<div style=\"width:500px;\">\n    <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/d19828070b665fa90c7860a996d256cf/4d297/credit_card_img.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 960px;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"credit card img\" title src=\"/static/d19828070b665fa90c7860a996d256cf/4d297/credit_card_img.png\" srcset=\"/static/d19828070b665fa90c7860a996d256cf/bc34b/credit_card_img.png 293w,\n/static/d19828070b665fa90c7860a996d256cf/da9f0/credit_card_img.png 585w,\n/static/d19828070b665fa90c7860a996d256cf/4d297/credit_card_img.png 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\">\n  </span>\n  </a>\n  </div>\n<p>We could go into the reasons of why Millennials are so hesitant on buying credit cards. But the bottom line is that there is clearly a lack of millennial centered credit cards on the market. <strong>This is where Uber can make its entry.</strong> It’s no coincidence that although its overall rewards are pretty lackluster, the card really shines in rewards for eating out and purchasing online, <strong>activities that Millennial dominate</strong>. Perks that include credit on streaming services like Netflix and Spotify hint that Uber is clearly positioning itself to capture the unsaturated (and growing) Millennial market segment.</p>\n<h3>Competitor Response?</h3>\n<p>So clearly there are reasonable business motives, defined distribution channels, and a robust target market. These are all positive signs for market entry. However, if competitors are overly aggressive in response to Uber’s entry, potential benefits may be severely dampened.</p>\n<p>To guess competitor responses it is often helpful to look at past cases of entry in the industry. There is however no historical precedent of a rideshare company issuing credit cards. Thus, I will be drawing parallels with <strong>airline credit cards as well as the broader credit card industry</strong>. While not perfect analogies I think there are some useful insights to be gained.</p>\n<h4>Lessons from Airline Credit Cards: Don’t make the card too specific</h4>\n<p>American Airlines and United were the first airlines to start giving miles for spending on their credit cards. Business was lucrative because airlines could now sell miles in advance to credit card companies. In addition, reward miles helped increase customer loyalty towards a specific airline. Obviously though other airlines started doing the same thing in order to lock in customers, saturating the field. Then, some credit card companies (like Discover it) started creating cards that could be used with any airline, in some cases <strong>diminishing the value of airline specific cards</strong></p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Preface"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"br","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"A lot is going on with Uber right now.
