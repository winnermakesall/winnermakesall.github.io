### Preface
<br />


A lot is going on with Uber right now. Pre IPO preparations are fully underway as the company is busily expanding its rewards program and developing self driving vehicles. Amongst all of this activity, I'd like analyze an Uber product that I feel is often overlooked: **The Uber Credit Card**. I understand that this is not a brand new product. But in this article I hope to demonstrate why Uber entered this market and why it structured the card the way it did. Furthermore, I'd like to illustrate the thought process a business uses when it considers entering a new market.
