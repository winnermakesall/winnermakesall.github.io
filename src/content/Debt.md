### Preface

"Debt is Bad" - this is a common mantra that pervades Silicon Valley, espoused by upstarts and veterans alike. Certainly debt does not make sense for an early stage software business. For these early stage companies, finding product-market fit is paramount and the high risk nature of these start-ups simply does not play nicely with debt financing.

Indeed this leads us to the fact that **because so many startups fail, equity investing is necessary.** However, against this supposed gospel, we take the contrarian view and believe as Alex Danco from Social Capital puts it **"so many startups fail because of equity investing."**

Why? Well for a more mature company that does have product-market fit and solvent unit economics, growth is the first priority. But the risk profile of growth operations looks drastically different than that of initial product development. It is far less risky and the payout is relatively more capped. For example, hiring a salesperson is less risky than trying to build out a new product; it will also have more limited returns.

Because of this limited upside, founders are reluctant to dilute their equity further to raise money for growth operations. This causes them to underinvest in distribution and growth and as Peter Thiel says **"Poor distribution — not product — is the number one cause of failure."**

What's more is that tech companies with established channels of recurring revenue do have the predictable cash flows needed to service debt. Take SaaS businesses for example, the monthly payments that SaaS users make is similar in structure to the cash flows of a monthly mortgage payment. The only difference is that one is backed by an asset and the other is backed by trust that mass churn won't occur. For an established SaaS company, this trust seems fair.

For these reasons we believe that debt is the missing piece for growth stage tech companies. But as we seek to defend this theory we come face-to-face with the old dogma "Debt is bad."

Perhaps, but rather than just accepting this as is. We will do the following:

### Agenda

1. Investigate the current problems with debt for growth stage tech companies
2. Examine better debt instruments
3. Reimagine the underwriting process using SaaS based metrics
4. Identify current companies who could potentially be the vendors of these new debt instruments.
